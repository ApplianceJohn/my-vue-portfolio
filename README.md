# My Portfolio in Vue 3

A project utilizing Vue, Vite, Bootstrap, and other tidbits as an exercise in front-end JS development and a bolster to my portfolio.

## Outline

-   About me
-   Web design projects

-   Website credits (technology used, licensing, links to repositories, etc)

## Tech used

-   Vue 3
-   Vite
-   Bootstrap 5
-   Sass (SCSS)

## Licensing

While I obviously own the intellectual property in the portfolio content, the overall project is under MIT licensing for editing and dissection if you wish to make your own personal site or app in Vue. No shame in a good reference!
